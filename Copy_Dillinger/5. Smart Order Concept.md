BlitzTrader offers unique features and mechanisms to streamline your trading execution logic effortlessly. In addition to supporting a native order API, which typically demands meticulous effort to code complex execution logic, it provides a highly potent and advanced concept for managing execution logic without delving into the intricacies of native order API state management. This enables traders to execute trades with greater ease and efficiency, freeing them from the burdensome task of handling intricate order API states. One of the standout features is the **SmartOrder**, which ensures that order cycles never go into wrong loops and precisely manages multiple order cycles in a controlled manner according to your trading execution logic.

It is always recommended to utilize the **SmartOrder** or **SmartOrderEx** Command over a native API. In this section, we will delve into the SmartOrder Command concept.

The SmartOrder Command mechanism is meticulously crafted to monitor the order state from its inception as a new order until it arrives at its terminal state, which could involve being completely filled, rejected, or canceled. Throughout this journey, the order may undergo multiple modification states. This robust mechanism is instrumental in streamlining the management of order states, guaranteeing efficient handling from initiation to terminal state of order.  
  
Similar to IVInfo, the SmartOrder Command is also bound to IVObject. However, unlike IVInfo, you can create multiple SmartOrder commands associated with IVObject. Each SmartOrder command operates independently, managing the order lifecycle autonomously. This provides strategy developers with the flexibility to define SmartOrders according to their unique design of strategy logic, enabling tailored order management strategies to be implemented effectively.  
  
To declare the SmartOrder commands, you would need to define them as follows:
```c#
private QX.Blitz.Core.IOrderCommand _entryOrderCommand = null;
private QX.Blitz.Core.IOrderCommand _exitOrderCommand = null;
```

  
These commands should then be mapped with the Strategy-defined IVObject in the OnInitialize method using the API **GetSmartOrderCommand** calls:

```
protected override void OnInitialize()
{
            _ivInfo = base.GetIVInfo(_ivObject);

            _entryOrderCommand = base.GetSmartOrderCommand("Entry", TimeInForce.GFD, _ivObject);
            _exitOrderCommand = base.GetSmartOrderCommand("Exit", TimeInForce.GFD, _ivObject);

            TraceLogInfo("Strategy Initialize Successfully");
}
```
The GetSmartOrderCommand API takes the following inputs: a unique identifier name, a TimeInForce value (e.g., GoodForDay, IOC etc), and the IVObject handle on which it will perform the order routing mechanism of associated market. It's important to note that no two SmartOrder command handles should have the same identifier name.

Once IOrderCommand is initialized, it is ready to manage the order life cycle.
> **Note:** Smart Order Command is one of the powerful features of the BlitzTrader API to enable quant developer with a standardized mechanism of managing the order state of an instrument with ease. Smart Order Command is represented by interface IOrderCommand and framework can provide template object by requesting with a function call GetSmartOrderCommand. GetSmartOrderCommand takes unique name identifier, order TimeInForce attribute and reference to your Instrument Variable to return the Smart Order Command. Following is important functions used to control the order routing behavior.

For instance, let's assume the strategy decides at any point to send an order using the _entryOrderCommand. The order management can be easily controlled using the Set method of IOrderCommand, as demonstrated below:

```
protected override void OnMarketDataEvent(StrategyMarketDataEventArgs strategyMarketDataEventArgs)
{

    // Below logic is quoting logic using smart order
    // which keep quoting at Best Buyer side and
    // avoiding itself to become best of own order


    OrderSide entrySide= OrderSide.Buy;

    // Identify quoting price 
    if (_entryOrderCommand.CurrentOrder == null)
        entryOrderPrice = _ivInfo.MarketDataContainer.GetBestBiddingPrice(entrySide);
    else if (entrySide == OrderSide.Sell)
        entryOrderPrice = _ivInfo.MarketDataContainer.GetBestBiddingPrice(_entryOrderCommand.CurrentOrder);


    _entryOrderCommand.Set(
        true,                                                                                                       
        entrySide, 
        OrderType.Limit,
        Input_OrderLotQty * _entryOrderCommand.IVInfo.LotSize,
        entryOrderPrice, 0);

     ……..
    ……

}
```
Explanation of Set method parameters:

- The first parameter (True) indicates that the order must proceed. If the order is already placed and open, it will modify the order with the new changed price. If set as False, all other parameters are irrelevant, and the order cancellation request is immediately initiated if the order is still in the open state.
- The second parameter denotes the OrderSide, which can be OrderSide.Buy or OrderSide.Sell.
- The third parameter represents the OrderType, which in this example is a LimitOrder.
- The fourth parameter indicates the OrderQuantity.
- The fifth parameter specifies the Order Limit Price.
The sixth parameter represents the Stop Order Price. This value is valid only if the OrderType is StopLimit.

As we delve into the functionality of the Set method, it becomes apparent that it plays a crucial role in managing the entire lifecycle of an order, from initiating a fresh order to modifying its state, such as adjusting the order price, until it reaches its terminal state.

When a SmartOrder reaches a terminal state, such as Completely Filled, it transitions into a passive state while retaining vital information pertaining to the order cycle. This information encompasses essential details like ClientOrderID, ExchangeOrderID, Order Status, Execution Status, Cumulative filled Quantity, Leaves Quantity, Average Filled Price, among others. Leveraging this information, the strategy logic can effectively determine the subsequent steps in the order execution process.

To prepare the SmartOrder for the next order cycle post reaching a terminal state, the Reset method comes into play. However, it's imperative to exercise caution and trigger the Reset method based on stringent risk check conditions established by the Strategy.

It's essential to note that an IOrderCommand only facilitates one order cycle at a time. In scenarios where multiple order cycles are required for the same instrument, it's recommended to define and initialize multiple IOrderCommand variables, each mapped to an IVObject, and utilize them accordingly.

As highlighted, if an OrderCommand transitions to a passive state with the Order Status indicating one of the terminal states, any subsequent calls to the Set method on the passive state will be disregarded. To ready the OrderCommand for the next order cycle, the Reset method must be employed. It's crucial to remember that the Reset method can only be applied to a passive OrderCommand, and it will fail if the Order state remains open as per Blitz OMS regulations.

In summary, the Reset method serves as a pivotal tool to prepare the OrderCommand for subsequent order cycles, ensuring a seamless and efficient trading experience on BlitzTrader's platform.


Use Reset method to make OrderCommand ready for next order cycle. 

```
string errorString = string.Empty;
 if (!_entryOrderCommand.Reset(out errorString))
  base.TraceLogError("Smart Order Resetting Failed. Reason : " + errorString);
```

We recommend the developer to use **Reset** method based on some strict risk check condition from Strategy.
