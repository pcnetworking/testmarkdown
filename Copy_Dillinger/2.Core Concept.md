
**BlitzTrader Core Concept**  
  
This section provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and terminology essential for understanding the workings of BlitzTrader. Mastery of these core concepts lays the foundation for leveraging the BlitzTrader API to develop proprietary strategies, exchange adapters, and trading tools within its ecosystem. By understanding these core concepts and utilizing the provided development tools, you'll be well-equipped to build and deploy successful algorithmic trading strategies with BlitzTrader.

**Strategy**

Strategy is the heart of BlitzTrader and it is algorithmic trading programs that define a set of instructions or rules for entering and exiting trades, with the goal of identifying alpha opportunities, managing market impact, or optimizing risk. Developers implement these entry and exit rules based on their market knowledge and hypotheses, and the strategy automatically executes trades in real-time. The BlitzTrader Strategy development API offers an environment for building rule-based strategies, enabling monitoring of real-time prices, order submission, cancellation or modification based on market data events, receiving order and fill updates, and accessing positions and real-time trade statistics. The Strategy development framework effectively decouples the core strategy business logic from the underlying complex software managing straight-through processing, providing a cleaner separation for developers to focus solely on their core trading and research strengths.

Quant developers leverages familiar tools like Visual Studio.NET IDE and the Microsoft.NET programming language. This allows developers to utilize existing skills and benefit from a comprehensive development environment with code IntelliSense and debugging capabilities. You can set breakpoints, step through code, and monitor values to refine your strategies during market simulation.  

**Strategy Instance**  

A Strategy Instance is a programmable component integrated and configured within the BlitzTrader platform. It functions akin to an object instantiated from a class during runtime. Its usability is contingent upon the system administrator assigning permissions and roles to trading users to utilize Strategies. Subsequently, it becomes the trading user's responsibility to curate a functional portfolio of strategies by allocating tradable instruments and configuring strategy parameters. This process of portfolio creation and parameter assignment is referred to as the Strategy Instance creation process.

BlitzTrader retains the Strategy Instance and preserves its state, including trade statistics. The lifecycle of a Strategy Instance persists until all associated instruments remain active or are explicitly deleted. In many intraday trading scenarios, traders prefer to initiate a fresh Strategy Instance every new trading day to ensure clean trade statistics and optimal performance.  

**Administrator**

The administrator has the authority to create trading users, assign strategies, exchange segments, and define risk constraints within the BlitzTrader platform.  
  
**Trading User**

A trading user login into the BlitzTrader trading dashboard to manage and control automated trading strategies. Each running strategy instance is owned by a trading user.

**Exchange/Broker Adapter**

A liquidity venue in BlitzTrader is identified as an Exchange Segment. BlitzTrader supports connectivity to multiple markets for market data information sourcing or order routing, or both. Each connection to the Exchange/Broker gateway system is managed by a programmable component called an Adapter. BlitzTrader provides a comprehensive framework and integration interface for developing connectivity adapters tailored to interact seamlessly with specific exchange or broker systems, thus facilitating Direct Market Access (DMA). These adapters play a pivotal role in enabling trading firms to establish fully transparent cross-region trading infrastructures, effectively connecting them to markets worldwide.

Acting as intermediaries, these adapters establish connection-oriented sessions with exchanges, ensuring efficient communication between the BlitzTrader Order Management System (OMS) and external systems. They play a crucial role in translating Blitz OMS messages into system-defined messages used by the exchange, and vice versa, ensuring smooth interoperability between platforms.

The BlitzTrader API offers a well-defined communication interface, ensuring seamless interaction between the BlitzTrader OMS and the Exchange adapter component. In its core functionality, the Exchange Adapter serves as the gateway to the liquidity provider, facilitating tasks such as market data sourcing, order routing, and execution.

Optionally, the Exchange Adapter can include additional functionalities, such as implementing a market data feeder, further enhancing its capabilities.

Moreover, BlitzTrader offers a FIX component that simplifies the development of FIX-based counterparty adapter plugins. This component provides comprehensive and high-performance support for the FIX standard, enabling efficient routing via FIX streams. This simplification streamlines the integration process and enhances overall performance, ensuring smooth communication between BlitzTrader and external FIX-based systems  
  
**Exchange Segment**

BlitzTrader empowers you to trade in diverse markets by offering connections to various exchanges and liquidity venues. In BlitzTrader, a liquidity venue is referred to as an **Exchange Segment**. BlitzTrader offers connectivity to multiple markets, allowing users to utilize them as sources of market data information, order routing, or both. Each connection to an Exchange/Broker gateway system is managed by a programmable component known as an Adapter. BlitzTrader provides a comprehensive API and framework for developing and integrating exchange adapters as plugin components.

Each adapter is uniquely identified by a name identifier called the **Exchange Segment**. Additionally, every tradable instrument is linked to a specific exchange segment. This linkage enables the BlitzTrader framework to easily identify the adapters responsible for routing orders for a particular instrument.

Below are some enumerated exchanges identifiers based on the exchanges they belong to:
| Exchanges                            | Exchange Segment Identifier |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| NSE Futures and Options Segment    | NSEFO                       |
| NSE Equity Segment                  | NSECM                       |
| NSE Commodity Segment               | NSECOM                      |
| BSE Futures and Options Segment    | BSEFO                       |
| BSE Equity Segment                 | BSECM                       |
| MCX Futures and Options (Commodities) | MCXFO                     |

**Instrument**

An instrument serves as a fundamental component of any trading system, containing essential information about tradable securities within a given exchange segment.  
  
The BlitzTrader API provides an abstract Instrument class that represents exchange-traded contracts, including Equities, Futures, Options, Spreads, and Spot (Forex). This class encapsulates all common properties defining the contract, such as name, exchange ID, exchange segment, tick size, lot size, etc. Additional properties specific to certain instrument types, such as expiration dates for derivative contracts (Futures, Options), strike prices, option types (CE, PE, CA, PA) for Options contracts, are embedded into concrete instrument type classes.

Custom properties of an Instrument can be added through an Extended Market Properties mechanism, facilitating the insertion of key-value pairs. BlitzTrader's framework establishes a process for importing tradable instrument definitions and persisting them internally.

The BlitzTrader Adapter, a programmable component representing the exchange segment, provides access to the market for both trading and market data interfaces. It is the responsibility of the Adapter to furnish the BlitzTrader framework with the list of tradable instruments.

| Name     | Security Type | Exchange Segment | TickSize | LotSize | Expiry    | StrikePrice | OptionType |
|----------|---------------|------------------|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| ESM15    | FUTURES       | CME              | 0.25     | 1       | June 2015 | -           | -          |
| GOOG     | EQUITY        | NASDAQ           | 0.01     | 1       | -         | -           | -          |
| NIFTY    | FUTURES       | NSEFO            | 0.05     | 50      | 26Feb2015 | -           | -          |
| SBIN     | OPTIONS       | NSEFO            | 0.05     | 500     | 26Feb2015 | 295.00      | CE         |
| RELIANCE | EQUITY        | NSECM            | 0.05     | 300     | -         | -           | -          |
| USD/INR  | FUTURES       | NSECD            | 0.0025   | 1000    | 26Feb2015 | -           | -          |
| EUR/USD  | FOREX         | FXCM             | 0.0001   | 1000    | -         | -           | -          |

For further details, please refer to the Adapter section on how to import Instrument definitions into BlitzTrader. BlitzTrader maintains a unique name for each instrument per exchange segment based on the following nomenclature.

| Instrument Types | Symbology                                         | Example           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Equity           | [Symbol Name]                                    | GOOG              |
| Spot             | [Symbol Name]                                    | EUR/USD           |
| Futures          | [Symbol Name] [Expiration Month] [Expiration Year] | NIFTY FEB 2015    |
| Options          | [Symbol Name] [Expiration Month] [Expiration Year] [Option Type] [Strike Price] | NIFTY FEB 2015 CE 8800 |

To access the Market Data Container interface of an Instrument from your strategy other than yourInstrument Variable can be done as: 

```c#
IMarketDataContainerInfo marketDataContainerInfo = base.GetMarketDataContainer(ExchangeSegment.NSEFO, "NIFTY FEB 2015 CE 8800"); 
if (marketDataContainerInfo != null) 
{ 
    ITouchLineInfo touchlineInfo = marketDataContainerInfo.TouchLineInfo; 
    double bestBidPrice = touchlineInfo.BestBidPrice;
     int bestBidSize = touchlineInfo.BestBidSize; 
    double bestAskPrice = touchlineInfo.BestAskPrice; 
    int bestAskSize = touchlineInfo.BestAskSize; 
    double lastPrice = touchlineInfo.LastPrice; 
    int lastSize = touchlineInfo.LastSize; 
    long lastTradedTime = touchlineInfo.LastTradedTime; 
} 
```

**Strategy Class Template**  
  
The BlitzTrader strategy is a typical class in your C# project of type.NET Class and inheriting from the provided framework class **QX.Blitz.Core.StrategyBase**

```c#
[StrategyAttribute("{611A7560-1353-4852-A916-1F5FC19277F2}", "XT.PairTradingX1", "Pair TradingStrategy", "X1", "QXT")]
public class MainStrategy : StrategyBase
{
}
```

Your strategy class MainStrategy implements some necessary overrides method of base class like **OnInitialize()**, **OnStart()**, **OnStop()**, **OnMarketDataEvent(), OnTrade()** etc.  to define how your strategy interacts with the Blitz algorithmic trading platform. Customize these methods with your specific logic to create a functional trading strategy. Save this code in a file named **MainStrategy.cs** within your C# project.  
  
As you see, the class is decorated with the Strategy attribute. The **StrategyAttribute** decorates the class, providing essential metadata such as a unique identifier (GUID), name, description, version, and owner of the strategy to the BlitzTrader platform. Adjust the attribute parameters according to your strategy's specifications.  
  
Your strategy development project may consist of multiple classes and dependencies on third-party components or external systems. However, it must include one primary class serving as the main strategy class, inheriting from **StrategyBase**. This main strategy class is crucial as it defines the core behavior and interactions of your strategy with the BlitzTrader platform.  
  
The following code structure of your strategy with file name MainStrategy.cs
```c#
using QX.Base.Common;
using QX.Base.Common.InstrumentInfo;
using QX.Base.Common.Message;
using QX.Base.Core;
using QX.Base.Data;
using QX.Blitz.Core;
using QX.Blitz.Core.Series;
using QX.Common.Helper;

[StrategyAttribute("{611A7560-1353-4852-A916-1F5FC19277F2}", "XT.PairTradingX1", "Pair TradingStrategy", "X1", "QXT")]
public class MainStrategy : StrategyBase
{
    // 1.   Define your Strategy static IVObject variables (Statically or Dynamically)
    // 2.   Define strategy Input and Output variables
    // 3.   Define strategy local variables as per your strategy logic
    // 4.   Define and Implements strategy Overrides methods
    // 5.   Use framework provided order execution and helper functions to build your 
               Strategy alpha and execution logics
}
```



Within your main strategy class, you have the flexibility to define various elements essential for your strategy's functionality including IVObject variables, strategy input and output variables, local variables, and override methods to implement your strategy logic.  Leveraging the functionalities provided by the BlitzTrader framework is essential for building your strategy's logic. These functionalities include order execution methods, market data and order event handling mechanisms, and more. Utilize these tools to implement your strategy's alpha generation and execution logic effectively.

**Strategy Input and Output Parameter (Page 2)**The algorithmic strategy often requires variable states that can be controlled or modified from the trading dashboard, or relayed its latest value to external monitoring systems.  
  
By tagging class variables with the **StrategyParameter** attribute, you enable them to be modified externally, providing flexibility and customization options for your strategy. Adjust the parameters and their default values according to your strategy's requirements such as order trade quantities or stop-loss limits etc.

In the Blitz .NET SDK, Strategy developers can designate certain internal variables of their Strategy class as input variables. These variables can then be modified or controlled by traders via the trading dashboard. Input variables are defined by placing the StrategyParameter attribute above the respective variable declarations.

Below is a code snippet from a sample strategy, where some global variables of the strategy class are tagged with the StrategyParameter attribute:

![Input Parameter](https://github.com/pcnetworking/Markdown/blob/main/images/Strategy%20Input%20and%20output%20parameter.png?raw=true)


All the variables tagged with **StrategyParameter** attribute will be available to trader dashboard for modification. The StrategyParameter constructor takes following input.

```c#
[StrategyParameterAttribute("SLLegPercentage", DefaultValue = 0, Description = "Stop Loss Percentage.", CategoryName = "Risk", DisplayName = "Stop Loss Percentage")]
private double Input_SLLegPercentage = 0;
```
In this snippet:

-The Input_SLLegPercentage variable is tagged with the StrategyParameter attribute.
-The StrategyParameter constructor is used to provide metadata for the input variable, including its name, default value, description, category name, and display name.
Once tagged with the StrategyParameter attribute, the variable becomes available for modification via the trader dashboard.

| Field Name    | Data Type | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name          | String    | The identifier used to denote a variable. The same name appears in the UI dashboard for a tagged variable. |
| Default Value | Object    | A default value of an input variable displayed in the trader dashboard. It holds all primitive data types defined in C#, including String. |
| Description   | String    | The description text used to describe the variable. It will be displayed in the trader dashboard for the corresponding name. |
| Category Name | String    | The various inputs are tagged under some logical user-defined category. The input variable will be displayed in the property grid under the given category group name. |


The trading dashboard allows to change any variable value of type input variable for given strategy instance register in server container.  
  
**The Output Parameter**  
  
Use output parameters to relay important information or calculated results from your strategy to the trading dashboard, providing traders with valuable insights and data visualization.

  
For example, some variables within the strategy might calculate proprietary information, and it's desirable to display the final result on the trading dashboard.

To achieve this, variables within the strategy class can be tagged with the **StrategyPublishParameter** attribute. Any change in the value of a variable tagged with this attribute will be relayed in realtime in the trading dashboard.  

Below is an example code snippet showcasing the usage of StrategyPublishParameter attribute:
```c#
[StrategyPublishParameter("EntryRound", DefaultValue = 0, Description = "Entry Round")]
private int Output_EntryRound = 0;
```
In this snippet:
-The Output_EntryRound variable is tagged with the StrategyPublishParameter attribute.
-The StrategyPublishParameter constructor is used to provide metadata for the output variable, including its name, default value, and description.
-Once tagged with the StrategyPublishParameter attribute, any change in the value of Output_EntryRound will be automatically displayed on the trading dashboard, enabling real-time monitoring of the strategy's output.

**The IVObject, the core of the strategy**  
  
Every trading strategy requires a market or instrument on which it listens for real-time market data information and decides to place orders as opportunities arise. In the BlitzTrader Strategy development framework, a fundamental concept known as **IVObject (Instrument Variable Object)** is introduced, which serves as the centerpiece of your strategy and abstractly defines the market. This concept enables building strategies in a market-neutral manner, allowing the framing of strategy logic without hard-coding the specific market on which the strategy ultimately executes.

**IVObject** facilitates creating strategies that can be applied across various markets or instruments without modification. It supports the development of both simple execution strategies, where opportunities are based on predefined market conditions, as well as more complex strategies such as options trading, where multiple strike price instruments are involved.

**IVObject** serves as a market-neutral representation of the instrument across any market or exchange, allowing strategies to remain adaptable and scalable across different trading environments.

The strategy framework offers support for both statically and dynamically defining IVObject variables. Static IVObject declaration and initialization are typically employed in simpler strategies, while dynamic IVObject creation becomes essential in more complex scenarios, such as options trading strategies involving multiple strike price instruments.
```
IVObject is market neutral representation of the instrument across any market or exchange
```
Here's an example of how to define a static IVObject variable named _ivInstrumentFutures in your strategy class.

```
private IVObject _ivInstrumentFutures = new IVObject(
      "FuturesIV",  // The Identifier Name
      "Futures Instrument",  // The description
      true,  // True means IV is tradable
      InstrumentType.Futures,  // The Instrument type Futures means only Futures instrument can be mapped to IVObject
      MarketDataType.All,  // The strategy subscribed for all the market data events
      OrderEventType.All   // The strategy subscribe for all the order event call back
);

```
The first argument represents the unique identifier name. This should be unique name across different instrument variable within the same strategy implementation class.

The fourth argument represents the asset class type of instrument variable

| Member name | Value | Description                            |
|-------------|-------|----------------------------------------|
| Futures     | 1     | Represents Futures contract            |
| Options     | 2     | Represents Options contract            |
| Spread      | 4     | Represents 2-Leg Spread contract      |
| Equity      | 8     | Represents Equity contract             |
| Spot        | 16    | Represents Spot contract (Forex)       |


The fifth argument requiredMarketDataType used to declare for the kind of market data event for the IVObject. The strategy must declare a callback function OnMarketDataEvent to receive registered market data events.  
  
**override void** OnMarketDataEvent **(**StrategyMarketDataEventArgs strategyMarketDataEventArgs**)**

Following are the events type that can be registered:

| Member name | Value | Description                                                                           |
|-------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| None        | 1     | Represents no market data event delivered as a callback event.                        |
| Touchline   | 2     | Represents level-I market data event delivered as a callback event.                    |
| MarketDepth | 4     | Represents level-II market data event delivered as a callback event.                   |

The fifth argument requiredOrderEventType  allow programmer to register for different order events that triggers during the order state changes during the order life cycle. This allows programmers to receive the order events as a callback function for a respective order state change.

| Member name                   | Value | Description                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| None                          | 1     | Represents no order event delivered as a callback.                                                  |
| OrderAccepted                 | 2     | Represents an order accepted event by the exchange delivered as a callback method.                  |
| OrderRejected                 | 4     | Represents an order rejected event by the exchange delivered as a callback method.                  |
| OrderModificationAccepted     | 8     | Represents an order modification request accepted by the exchange delivered as a callback method.   |
| OrderModificationRejected     | 16    | Represents an order modification request rejected event by the exchange delivered as a callback method. |
| OrderCancellationAccepted     | 32    | Represents an order cancellation request accepted event by the exchange delivered as a callback method. |
| OrderCancellationRejected     | 64    | Represents an order cancel request rejected event by the exchange delivered as a callback method.  |
| OrderTraded                   | 128   | Represents an order traded event by the exchange delivered as a callback method.                    |
| OrderTriggered                | 256   | Represents a stop order triggered event by the exchange delivered as a callback method.             |
| All                           | 510   | Represents all above events by exchange delivered on their respective callback method.              |

If you are developing a pair trading strategy, you might require the declaration of two static IVObject variables, named _ivPair1 and _ivPair2.
Similarly, if you are developing a conversion reversal strategy, you might need to declare three static IVObject variables: _ivFuturesLeg, _ivCallOptionsLeg, and _ivPutOptionsLeg.
However, it's crucial to note that all static IVObject variables declared within the strategy must be returned as a collection from the following override method. This step is mandatory for proper recognition of the declared IVObjects by the Blitz trading platform.

public override IVObject[] IVObjects
```
public class MainStrategy : StrategyBase
{

    private IVObject _ivFuturesLeg = new IVObject("FuturesIV", "Futures Instrument", true,
                                                           InstrumentType.Futures,
                                                           MarketDataType.All, OrderEventType.All);

    private IVObject _ivCallLeg = new IVObject("CallIV", "Call Instrument", true,
                                                           InstrumentType.Options,
                                                           MarketDataType.All, OrderEventType.All);

    private IVObject _ivPutLeg = new IVObject("PutIV", "Put Instrument", true,
                                                           InstrumentType.Options,
                                                           MarketDataType.All, OrderEventType.All);


     

      public override IVObject[] IVObjects
      {
            get
            {
                List<IVObject> _ivObjectArray = new List<IVObject>();
                _ivObjectArray.Add(_ivFuturesLeg);
                _ivObjectArray.Add(_ivCallLeg);
                _ivObjectArray.Add(_ivPutLeg);

                return _ivObjectArray.ToArray();
            }
        }

}
```

>**Note:**  
`All static IVObjects are mapped to actual tradable instruments by the trader from the trading dashboard using a process called **Instance Creation of Strategy**. This mapping process can also be automated using a Strategy Plugin concept programmed within the UI dashboard using plugin SDK.`

>`For instance, a simple automation could involve creating a strategy instance automatically from a user-defined CSV file that specifies the instrument to be mapped to the IVObject, along with initializing default input variable values. This automation streamlines the setup process and ensures that strategies can be deployed efficiently across different instruments or markets.`
